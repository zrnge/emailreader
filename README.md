## Installation
1. Install Python 3.8+ (with Tkinter).
2. Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/zrnge/emailreader.git
```
```   
cd emailreader
```
```   
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Converting to a Windows EXE
   
You can create a standalone .exe so users don’t need Python installed.

Install PyInstaller:
```
pip install pyinstaller
```

From the project folder, run:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed email_reader.py
--onefile puts everything into a single .exe
```
--windowed prevents a console window from appearing (GUI only)

The executable will appear in the dist/ folder:

dist/email_reader.exe
You can move or share this .exe directly with other Windows users.
